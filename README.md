Your sweet Terminal Editor pal.

Tedy ðŸ§¸ is a Terminal Editor written in Ink + Typescript. Meaning it's using
NodeJS behind the scenes.

**!IMPORTANT:** this project is in development and will experience:

- Lots of bugs
- Lots of "quirky" (read: unforeseen) behaviour on Windows / Linux as I'm
  developing and testing on MacOS
- Lots of missing features

If you're experiencing an issue, please please please
[report it](https://github.com/jeroenptrs/tedy)!
